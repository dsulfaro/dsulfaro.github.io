		<h1>Hello, everyone!</h1>
		<h3>Welcome to my website! My name is Dan, and I'm a linguist turned programmer from Michigan. While attending school, I thought "Hmm..Spanish and Italian are cool, so let's learn some computer languages too!" and a passion was born. Or discovered? At any rate, I hope this website gives you a comprehensive overview of my formal and not-so-formal education.</h3>

<div id="portfolio" class="container-fluid">
	<h1 class="header"><strong>Portfolio</strong></h1>
	<h2 id="portDesc">Below is a collection of a few projects I've completed. Code for these and a few other projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dsulfaro" id="g">github</a>. New projects to be added weekly!</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<a href="http://www.splitsmart.xyz" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Splitsmart</h2>
			<img src="images/splitsmart.jpg">
			<p>A full stack web app that allows users to split expenses between friends; the backend is written in Rails and uses React/Redux for the frontend. I was suprised how easy a bidirectional friending system was to create. That and using Redux to organize the code made this a really rewarding project.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://dansulfaro.com/intro_to_animations/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>I Can Animate and So Can You!</h2>
			<img src="images/animate.jpg">
			<p>I saw that there was no interactive tutorial on CSS3 Animations so I decided to make one myself. Inspired by Flexbox Froggy, this nifty little 10-level game introduces the user to CSS3 animations and how easy they are the implement. I hope to add more levels in the future.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dans-new-tab/fgmlnkhlfgijamohecjjhnbpmgjldele?authuser=1" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>New Tab Page</h2>
			<img src="images/new_tab.jpg">
			<p>This is my first Chrome extension that replaces the default new tab page with one that presents a notepad, the weather, a quote, and news data. It's all your info in one place! I was also able to cache some data allowing the notepad notes to persist as well as reducing the number of API calls.</p>
		</div></a>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/eZoWRZ/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Quote Generator</h2>
			<img src="images/quotes.jpeg">
			<p>Presents a random quote every time the user presses the generate button. A tweet button also allows the user to tweet the quote to their twitter account. I used the API from quotesondesign.com, but I've also built a web scraper in Ruby that scrapes the quote of the day.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/ZWZPaX/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Weather App</h2>
			<img src="images/weather.jpeg">
			<p>Gets the user's location, displays it on the screen, and then used that information to display the weather for that location. This app makes two different API calls, and the background image dynamically changes depending on the weather. I also built an Android app that accomplishes the same thing.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/yOWpdG/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Wikipedia Viewer</h2>
			<img src="images/wikipedia.jpeg">
			<p>With this app, the user can either click a button and be taken to a random wikipedia page, or they can search for anything their heart desires. This app uses the wikipedia API.</p>
		</div></a>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/BKXYEx/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>TwitchTV Channel Display</h2>
			<img src="images/twitch.jpeg">
			<p>Using this app, the viewer can see current twitch channels that are streaming as well as the content that they are showcasing. The channel names are in a predermined array which can be easily modified to show more or less channels. Channels that are streaming are displayed at the top.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/oLNjOG/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Javascript Calculator</h2>
			<img src="images/calculator.jpeg">
			<p>Not much to say about this app...it's a calculator!  It can do the four basic operations, and the user can string them together to evaluate more complicated expressions. The buttons also change color. Neat!</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/MeWeJR/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Pomodoro Clock</h2>
			<img src="images/clock.jpeg">
			<p>A pomodoro clock is a tool used to increase productivity. The idea is that one sets an amount of time (default 25 minutes) to work on something and then an extra few minutes as a break, and this app does just that. The user can input any time they wish for both the break and the work session.</p>
		</div></a>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/OXJjMd/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>TicTac2.0</h2>
			<img src="images/tic.jpeg">
			<p>I'm just gonna lay this out there: I think TicTacToe is a dumb game. It can end in a draw, and the person who goes first has a huge advantage. That's why I made an updated version of the game. Good luck against my super smart AI (Hint: it chooses squares at random...)</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/XKWErQ/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Simon Says</h2>
			<img src="images/simon.jpeg" class="android">
			<p>It's that game you know and love! The game features two modes: normal which uses the same pattern and strict which changes the pattern whenever the player messes up. Getting the sound for the buttons was way easier than I anticipated. Have fun!</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/YWPjMV" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>CodePlayer</h2>
			<img src="images/codePlayer.jpeg">
			<p>This app allows the user to enter in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and then press a RUN button that then displays there code in a results tab. The tabs and be toggled and are sized accordingly. Getting the tabs to be the correct size was the trickiest part about this app. One of the first apps I ever built!</p>
		</div></a>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/QEybjR" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>NPR News Ticker</h2>
			<img src="images/npr.jpeg">
			<p>My first app using AngularJS (and a little Sass thrown in) displays the top news stories from NPR.  Getting used to the new framework was the most difficult part, and there are still a few small bugs I need to iron out, but the concept is there.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/OXNXrM" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Mondrian Paint</h2>
			<img src="images/mondrian.jpeg">
			<p>I saw someone else make this online and decided to do it myself.  Using jQuery it was super easy.  It was more of an exercise on HTML and CSS than anything as making the canvas was actually the most difficult part, but I'm happy with the way it turned out. Maybe I'll remake this using a js framework in the future.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/MeyXWR" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Disco Square Thing</h2>
			<img src="images/disco.jpeg">
			<p>Yup. I made a thing. Stare into this and contemplate life and its mysteries.</p>
		</div></a>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/KMMJqr" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Angular Todo List</h2>
			<img src="images/todo.jpeg">
			<p>I love Angular! Definitely my favorite framework. This project is simple at the moment but I want to add more features like a counter with how many tasks there are and maybe so nice animations.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/mERKeb" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>Angular Minesweeper</h2>
			<img src="images/minesweeper.jpeg">
			<p>A slightly larger angular app of the classic game with cutting edge graphics. The hardest part about this project was getting the correct numbers to display in each square if they were near a mine; the function that did this took a lot of careful tweaking, but I eventually got it working beautifully.</p>
		</div></a>
		<a href="http://codepen.io/dsulfaro/pen/WxjBOv" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>React Interactive List</h2>
			<img src="images/reactList.jpeg">
			<p>This is my first ever React.js app. It's a cross between a todo list and a grocery list I suppose. It was more of an exercise on getting started with React seeing as how it doesn't do much...but I can see myself using something like this in another app.</p>
		</div></a>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<a href="https://codepen.io/dsulfaro/full/wWZAmw/" target="_blank"><div class="col-md-4 project">
			<h2>React Markdown Previewer</h2>
			<img src="images/markdown.jpeg">
			<p>I don't use markdown much, but this app takes markdown and spits out what it would look like to the right. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to use the compiler, but it ended up being fairly straight-forward in the end. Wooh!</p>
